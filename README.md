# Node JS Blogs

My first NodeJS Project. honestly I have no idea what I really spent the last week righting but it works somehow and it does what I needed it to do.

It is extremely basic and the most difficult thing I have done is reference a MongoDB database that houses the blogs and pulls the IDs for the blogs.
  and I still dont know how it really works just that someone wrote on StackOverflow that it works and they were right!
  
If you are reading the code and you see something and think `Why the hell would he write this, its terrible and slow and bad` well you can know why because this code is riddled  with comments. No mysteries here.

I do not need feedback I know its bad, unless you're lying and want to praise me ðŸ™‚

Anyway, I had fun doing it!

bye bye
