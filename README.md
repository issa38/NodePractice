# NodePractice
Where I shame myself with horrible attempts at NodeJS coding :)

Most of the code here is going to be bad. Like unreadably bad and slow but it's fine because I am learning right :)

Most of the files here are going to be fairly basic but I will eventually try something hard, like making a calculator 😐

Bare with me. I am learning and maybe one day I can write some code in 5 minutes with only 1 minute of googling why it works instead of coding for 5 minutes and 30 minutes trying to understand the problem just so I can google it :P

bye bye
